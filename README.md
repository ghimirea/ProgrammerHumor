React program that retrieves top 20 topics from r/ProgrammerHumor from Reddit and sorts them by number of comments in descending order

## The challenge took me around 5 hours to complete, had to accommodate my work and this assignment together. 

## I used styled-components for my CSS and since this is the first time using it, I had to learn how to use it.

## I also used grid layout which I was not that familiar with, so that took time

## Took some time to learn how to use the Reddit API, documentation is confusing.

## I decided to make the topics as a card component which works great with the grid layout system.

## I was not able to do the unit test.
